Analysis to evaluate the weather conditions in the Covid-19 cases

Flu typically has a considerable improvement during cold (winter months) and less cases in summer months. But, Covid-19 has the same comportment as any other flu virus?

I carried out a Data Science exercise in Python, whose purpose was evaluating the confirmed cases of Covid-19 in some cities, where they had high numbers of infected. To considering both climatic conditions scenarios, I gathered data from cities in the northern hemisphere (period of low temperatures) and the southern hemisphere (with higher temperatures).

To perform this exercise, I used Python to prepare, clean and make the information available.

With the available data, we can ask the following question: The number of Covid-19 infected is related to weather conditions?
